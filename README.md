JSocial – FED2 JS2 Course Assignment

This is my course assignment project for JavaScript 2.

It’s a small social media front-end where users can:

-Register & login with a Noroff email
-Create, edit, and delete their own posts
-View all posts in a feed and search them
-View single post details
-See their profile (with their own posts)
-View other profiles and their posts
-Follow/unfollow other users
-See who follows them and who they follow

Used:

-JavaScript (ES6 modules)
-Bootstrap 5 for styling
-Vite for development & build
-Netlify for hosting
-Noroff API for auth, posts, and profiles
